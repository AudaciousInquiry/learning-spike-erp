# Data Generation

* [`generator-cli`](https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/learning-spike-erp/tree/master/generator-cli) is a tool for simulating low-fidelity, high-volume bed availability data. Currently it simulates data for **a single day** ("t0"), but we plan to extend it to simulate a time-course of data.

* [`generated`](https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/learning-spike-erp/tree/master/generated) contains a small amount of generated data, to make it easy to explore and compare formats. The generator simulates data for a (configurable) number of organizations, and for each organization it creates four JSON files (the tool can also output XML, but we'll focus on JSON for documentation below):

  * `Org-###.json` (see [example](https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/learning-spike-erp/blob/master/generated/t0/Org-1067.json)): This file models a hospital, using a single FHIR Organization and a single Location, which corresponds to a physical site (e.g., a hospital building). These resources are simulated based on data from https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals, which includes hospital names and geocoordiantes.
  
  * `Org-###-beds.json` (see [example](https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/learning-spike-erp/blob/master/generated/t0/Org-1067-beds.json)): This `-beds` file models a set of "raw" bed status data for a given hospital. The simulation knows how many beds to simulate for a given hospital, and randomly assigns each bed to some combination of these attributes {location status, physical type, operational status, isolation status, and site}. Based on our defaults, 36 distinct combinations of these attributes are possible.

  * `Org-###-groups.json` (see [example](https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/learning-spike-erp/blob/master/generated/t0/Org-1067-groups.json)): This `-groups` file summarizes the `-beds` data by creating a number of Groups, following the "saner BedGroup" profile. For each combination with more than zero beds assigned, the simulation creates a saner BedGroup to include in the "-groups" file (up to 36 combinations in the currenty simulation, which uses only a small subset of allowed attribute values; this would grow much larger if we used the full range of bed types statuses, and features).
  
  * `Org-###-measureReports.json` (see [example](https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/learning-spike-erp/blob/master/generated/t0/Org-1067-measureReports.json)): This `-measureReports` file summarizes the `-beds` data using a single MeasureReport. Instead of creating a new group for each facet, we create a new `stratum` within this MeasureReport, which means we  way, we get one MeasureReport per organization, with up to 36 strata contained inside. (Note taht even though there's only a single MeasureReport, we still wrap it in a Bundle here for consistency across our four main outputs and ease in loading.)

These simulations are rough and quick - please let us know if you spot any bugs, either as as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/learning-spike-erp/issues) or [on zulip](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/226195-Covid-19-Response).

## Notes on Group vs MeasureReport


### Experience Notes:

MeasureReport "feels" nicer when you start including time periods for which a report is generated. Group doesn't have great semantics around time, particularly in the context of updates/trends. So in a Group-based reporting system, we'd need to decide one something like:

a) generate a new Group for each combination for each day (and put it in name?)
b) reuse/update the same set of Groups each day (if the server supports this, and versioning)
c) something else?


#### Payload size / complexity

The MeasureReport- and Group-based approaches are are similar in terms of line count and file size. When pretty-printed, MeasureReport bundles are shorte in line-count but ~25% larger on-disk; in compacted JSON, MeasureReport bundles are slightly smaller on-disk.


### Coming soon:

Change datasets for time periods. Will allow for variation over time (hence the t0 folder). Upload scripts.
